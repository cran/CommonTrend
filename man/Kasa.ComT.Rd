\title{Common Trend(s) according to Kasa(1992)}
\description{ 
   Extract Common Trend(s) from a cointegration system according to
   Kasa(1992). Loading Matrix and Othogonal Complement of alpha and
   beta are also reported. 
}
\usage{Kasa.ComT(data, rank, k) 
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{ Data used to construct the cointegration system}
  \item{rank}{ Number of cointegration vectors specified}
  \item{k}{Lag order in VECM}

}

\details{

 Common trends extracted using Kasa's method does not necessarily correspond to the Permanent part in the original series.
 But the advantage of this method is that it only uses \eqn{\beta} to construct common trends, and \eqn{\beta} has a nice propery which \eqn{\alpha} does not have: Super Consistent.

 Though this method does not involve \eqn{\alpha}, \eqn{\alpha} is also reported for your convenience.

 Currently this function assumes that no determinstic parts, such as
 the constant and the trend, are in the Error-Correction Terms (ECT).
 But it does allow the existence of constant term in the VECM (just outside ECT).
